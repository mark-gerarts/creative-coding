# Magnetic grid

The sketch is based on an [elm-canvas
example](https://chimeces.com/elm-canvas/animated-grid.html), with the main
purpose being to understand mouse events in Elm.

Run it with [elm-live](https://github.com/wking-io/elm-live) for convenience:

```
$ elm-live src/Main.elm --open --start-page=index.html -- --output=elm.js
```
